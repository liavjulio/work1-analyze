Matrix Inversion and Norm Calculation
This repository contains a set of functions for matrix operations including calculating the determinant, multiplying matrices, finding the inverse of a 3x3 matrix, and computing the 1-norm of a matrix.

Functions
get_minor
The get_minor function calculates the minor of a matrix by removing a specified row and column.
determinant
The determinant function calculates the determinant of a square matrix recursively.
multiply_matrix
The multiply_matrix function performs matrix multiplication.
find_inverse_matrix
The find_inverse_matrix function computes the inverse of a 3x3 matrix using elementary row operations.
inverse
The inverse function checks if the matrix is singular and finds its inverse.
matrix_1_norm
The matrix_1_norm function calculates the 1-norm of a given matrix.
